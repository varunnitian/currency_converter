# currency_converter
One of the best ways to revise basic concepts is to build a basic project, and thereâ€™s nothing easier than a converter. All you have to do is take input of the currency required and display the output accordingly. There also needs to be a way to customize the currencies from some sort of menu or dropdown. Data for the conversion can be fetched from an external file, or simply stored as a separate module.A converter should have some validation to ensure that the conversion works only on numeric data. An error should be displayed for invalid data accordingly.
